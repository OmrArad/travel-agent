# Prompt Engineering Decisions

## Core Strategy

### Dual Prompt Approach
- **Chain-of-Thought**: For complex queries (planning, budgets, comparisons)
- **Standard Prompt**: For simple queries (weather, tips, recommendations)

**Decision**: Complex travel planning requires structured reasoning to break down budgets and logistics, while simple queries benefit from direct responses.

### Travel-Only Focus
- Strict filtering to travel-related topics only
- Polite redirection for non-travel queries
- Comprehensive travel vocabulary detection

**Decision**: Ensures the assistant stays focused on its core purpose and provides clear boundaries.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Context Management
- **History Limit**: 10 messages with automatic cleanup
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains conversation context across interactions
- **Smart Context Building**: Includes relevant conversation history in prompts

**Decision**: Balances context retention with processing efficiency and prevents token overflow.

### 2. Response Structure
- **Markdown Formatting**: For readability and structure
- **Follow-up Questions**: Natural, contextual follow-ups (not forced)
- **Direct Address**: Uses "you" for personal engagement
- **Emojis**: For visual appeal and quick scanning

**Decision**: Makes responses scannable, engaging, and mobile-friendly while maintaining natural conversation flow.

### 3. Weather Integration
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies weather queries using pattern matching
- **Data Enhancement**: Injects real weather data into prompts when available
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works without weather API for basic functionality

**Decision**: Provides real-time data when available but doesn't break core functionality without it.

### 4. Error Handling
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Avoids specific claims when uncertain
- **Confidence Indicators**: Uses qualifying language for uncertain information
- **Graceful Failures**: Continues conversation even when external APIs fail

**Decision**: Builds user trust by being transparent about limitations and avoiding made-up information.

## Model Configuration

### Settings
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity vs consistency)
- **Top_p**: 0.9 (diverse vocabulary while staying safe)
- **Max Tokens**: 2048 (comprehensive responses without verbosity)

**Decision**: Optimized for engaging travel advice while maintaining reliability and reasonable response times.

## Prompt Architecture

### Modular Design
- **Base Prompt**: Shared guidelines and policies
- **Specialized Prompts**: Chain-of-thought and standard variants
- **DRY Principle**: Common sections maintained in one place

**Decision**: Ensures consistency, maintainability, and reduces duplication while preserving functionality.

## Key Innovations

1. **Intelligent Query Classification**: Automatically detects complex vs simple queries
2. **Context-Aware Follow-ups**: Generates relevant questions based on conversation history
3. **Weather-Aware Responses**: Integrates real data seamlessly into travel advice
4. **Conversation Flow Management**: Handles follow-up responses like "yes", "no" naturally

**Decision**: Creates a more natural, helpful conversation experience that feels like talking to a knowledgeable travel expert.
